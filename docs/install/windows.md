## Installation

### 1. Download
Download the installer from 
[pelton.app/download](https://pelton.app/download)
or from 
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/peltonapp/Pelton/releases/latest)

- [x] Download Installer

??? info "Portable Installations and Package Managers (Winget/Chocolatey)"
    Every release also ships a portable build, named
    `Pelton-<VERSION>-windows-amd64-portable.exe`. It is the same executable the
    installer wraps, just on its own: Pelton is a single file, so the installer
    only adds the Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts and the entry in
    **Add or remove programs**.

    Put it wherever you like, a USB stick included, and run it. Nothing is
    installed and nothing is registered.

    !!! warning "Portable means the app, not your mail"
        Your mailboxes, messages and settings live in `%APPDATA%\Pelton`, in the
        Windows profile of whoever runs it, **not** next to the `.exe`. Carrying
        the file to another machine gives you Pelton there, not your mail, and
        deleting the file leaves that data behind. To remove it as well, delete
        `%APPDATA%\Pelton` too.

    To update a portable install, download the newer `.exe` and replace the old
    one. There is nothing to uninstall first, and your mail is untouched because
    it was never in that file.

    Pelton is not yet in the Chocolatey or Winget registry.
    However, this will be done in the future. See [#376](https://github.com/peltonapp/Pelton/issues/376)

!!! tip "Verify Checksum"
    It's **highly recommended** to verify the Checksum (SHA-256 hash) of the file you've downloaded.
    
    **What is a checksum verification?**

    Verifying the checksum means comparing a hash, 
    a short fingerprint calculated from the file's contents, 
    against the one Pelton publishes, 
    so you can confirm the download **wasn't corrupted or tampered** with in transit.
    
    **How to verify**

    When downloading from [pelton.app/download](https://pelton.app/download), you will get commands which will
    verify the checksum: ![The download page's checksum verify commands for PowerShell and Command Prompt](../assets/screenshots/screenshot-download-installer-checksum.png)
    To run one, open PowerShell or Command Prompt, navigate to your downloads folder with
    `cd $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads` (PowerShell) or `cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads` (Command Prompt), then run the
    command from the website.

    If it says `Match` then you can **proceed** with the installation and everything is fine.

    If it says `Mismatch` then the file got corrupted or was tampered with. **Do not proceed.** You can try repeating the download,
    or [reach out for help](../support.md) if it keeps happening.

    - [x] Verify SHA-256 Checksum

### 2. Installing Pelton

Run the downloaded file. The filename should look something like this: `Pelton-<VERSION>-windows-amd64-installer.exe`.

- [x] Run Installer

You will probably run into SmartScreen not allowing you to run Pelton. It might look something like this:

![Windows SmartScreen warning: "Windows protected your PC", with "More info" highlighted](../assets/screenshots/screenshot-windows-smartscreen-more-info.png){ width=350 }

???+ info "Why is SmartScreen not allowing Pelton to run?"
    SmartScreen flags any app it doesn't yet recognize as coming from a trusted publisher. Code-signing
    certificates that satisfy SmartScreen cost money every year, and enough people need to run the app before
    SmartScreen starts trusting it automatically.

Click `More info`, then click `Run anyway`:

- [x] Allow through SmartScreen

Pelton will now start. Go through the Onboarding wizard. To add your first mailbox, see [Setting up a mailbox](../mailbox/index.md).
