// backgroundWorkGrace is how long a test waits for the app's goroutines after

// testContext returns the context a test's App should run on, together with the
// cleanup that stops the goroutines started under it.
//
// Bindings hand work to goSafe and return, so a test that calls one returns
// while that work is still running. Cleanups run in reverse, which put the
// store's Close and the temp directory's removal ahead of goroutines still
// using both: the database was closed under them, and sqlite recreated its
// -wal and -shm sidecars inside a directory the test framework was in the
// middle of deleting, which surfaced as a "directory not empty" failure on
// whichever test happened to lose the race.
//
// Register the returned cleanup last, after the store's own, so it runs first
// and the store is still open when the goroutines finish with it:
//
//	ctx, stopBackground := testContext(t)
//	store, err := storage.Open(filepath.Join(t.TempDir(), "test.db"))
//	t.Cleanup(func() { _ = store.Close() })
//	t.Cleanup(stopBackground)
